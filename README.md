# IZMA-Web-Design
To run the project it is enough to start a php server for example: `php -S 0.0.0.0:8000`.

## The code
* The page runs on the fullPage.js, uses Bootstrap 4 and jQuery.
* `index.php` contains the html page.
* The `include` folder contains code parts that are included in the `index.php`.
* All css rules are in the `css/main.css` and all the custom JavaScript is in the `js/main.js`. This js file is repsonsible for fullPage.js initialization.
